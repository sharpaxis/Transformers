# Transformers Repository

Welcome to the **Transformers** repository! This is a collection of my work related to transformer models, including code for fine-tuning, visualizations, and implementations from scratch. Whether you're exploring the internals of transformer architectures or experimenting with pre-trained models, this repository has something for you.

## Contents

### 1. Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Models
Here you'll find code and tutorials for fine-tuning transformer models like BERT, GPT, T5, Llama, and others on various tasks. Topics include:
- Dataset preparation and preprocessing
- Custom training scripts
- Evaluation and metrics for downstream tasks

### 2. Visualizations
This section contains scripts and tools for visualizing various aspects of transformer models, such as:
- Attention mechanisms
- Token embeddings
- Model performance metrics

### 3. Transformers from Scratch
Dive into the internals of transformer architectures with implementations from scratch, covering:
- Scaled dot-product attention
- Multi-head attention
- Position-wise feed-forward networks
- Positional encodings
- Training loop implementations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the example)
- Hugging Face Transformers library (for pre-trained models)
- Visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly

### Usage
Clone this repository and navigate to the desired folder to explore the code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/transformers.git
cd transformers
```
